Viewing Results
===============

*This chapter describes the different ways in which the results of an
analysis as well as the basic network input data can be viewed. These
include different map views, graphs, tables, and special reports.*

-------

.. _sec-view_results_map:

Viewing Results on the Map
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  There are several ways in which database values and results of a
  simulation can be viewed directly on the Network Map:

  -  For the current settings on the Map Browser (see :numref:`sec-map_browser`), the
     nodes and links of the map will be colored according to the color-
     coding used in the Map Legends (see :numref:`sec-map_legends`). The map's coloring
     will be updated as a new time period is selected in the Browser.

  -  When the Flyover Map Labeling program preference is selected (see
     :numref:`sec-prog_pref`), moving the mouse over any node or link will display its
     ID label and the value of the current viewing parameter for that node
     or link in a hint-style box.

  -  ID labels and viewing parameter values can be displayed next to all
     nodes and/or links by selecting the appropriate options on the
     Notation page of the Map Options dialog form (see :numref:`sec-map_disp_ops`).

  -  Nodes or links meeting a specific criterion can be identified by
     submitting a Map Query (see below).

  -  You can animate the display of results on the network map either
     forward or backward in time by using the Animation buttons on the Map
     Browser. Animation is only available when a node or link viewing
     parameter is a computed value (e.g., link flow rate can be animated
     but diameter cannot).

  -  The map can be printed, copied to the Windows clipboard, or saved as
     a DXF file or Windows metafile.


**Submitting a Map Query**

  A Map Query identifies nodes or links on the network map that meet a
  specific criterion (e.g., nodes with pressure less than 20 psi, links
  with velocity above 2 ft/sec). An example of a map query is provided in :numref:`fig-results_map_query`.

  ..

  To submit a map query:
  
    1. Select a time period in which to query the map from the Map Browser.

    2. Select **View >> Query** or click |image116| on the Map Toolbar.

    3. Fill in the following information in the Query dialog form that
       appears:

       -  Select whether to search for Nodes or Links

       -  Select a parameter to compare against

       -  Select **Above**, **Below,** or **Equals**

       -  Enter a value to compare against

    4. Click the **Submit** button. The objects that meet the criterion will
       be highlighted on the map.

    5. As a new time period is selected in the Browser, the query results
       are automatically updated.

    6. You can submit another query using the dialog box or close it by
       clicking the button in the upper right corner.



  After the Query box is closed the map will revert back to its
  original display.

.. _sec-view_results_graph:

Viewing Results with a Graph
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Analysis results, as well as some design parameters, can be viewed
  using several different types of graphs. Graphs can be printed,
  copied to the Windows clipboard, or saved as a data file or Windows
  metafile. :numref:`table-type_plots` lists the types of graphs that can be used to view values
  for a selected parameter.

.. _sec-view_results_table:

Viewing Results with a Table
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  EPANET allows you to view selected project data and analysis results
  in a tabular format:

    -  A Network Table lists properties and results for all nodes or links
       at a specific period of time.

    -  A Time Series Table lists properties and results for a specific node
       or link in all time periods.



  Tables can be printed, copied to the Windows clipboard, or saved to
  file. An example table is shown in :numref:`fig-ex_network_table`.

  .. _fig-ex_network_table:
  .. figure:: media/image83.png
     :alt: Example Network Table for Nodes in EPANET
   
     Example network table for nodes.
  ..

  To create a table:

    1. Select **View >> Table** or click |image127| on the Standard Toolbar.

    2. Use the Table Options dialog box that appears to select:

       -  The type of table

       -  The quantities to display in each column

       -  Any filters to apply to the data


  The Table Selection options dialog form has three tabs as shown in
  :numref:`fig-table_select`. All three tabs are available when a table is first
  created. After the table is created, only the Columns and Filters
  tabs will appear. The options available on each tab are as follows:

  .. _fig-table_select:
  .. figure:: media/image84.png
     :alt: Table Selection Dialog in EPANET
   
     Table selection dialog.
  ..

**Type Tab**

  The Type tab of the Table Options dialog is used to select the type
  of table to create. The choices are:

    -  All network nodes at a specific time period

    -  All network links at a specific time period

    -  All time periods for a specific node

    -  All time periods for a specific link


  Data fields are available for selecting the time period or node/link
  to which the table applies.


**Columns Tab**

  The Columns tab of the Table Options dialog form (:numref:`fig-columns_tab`)
  selects the parameters that are displayed in the table’s columns.

    -  Click the checkbox next to the name of each parameter you wish to
       include in the table, or if the item is already selected, click in
       the box to deselect it. (The keyboard's Up and Down Arrow keys can be
       used to move between the parameter names, and the spacebar can be
       used to select/deselect choices).

    -  To sort a Network-type table with respect to the values of a
       particular parameter, select the parameter from the list and check
       off the **Sorted By** box at the bottom of the form. (The sorted
       parameter does not have to be selected as one of the columns in the
       table.) Time Series tables cannot be sorted.

  ..

**Filters Tab**

   The Filters tab of the Table Options dialog form (:numref:`fig-filters_tab`) is
   used to define conditions for selecting items to appear in a table.
   To filter the contents of a table:

    -  Use the controls at the top of the page to create a condition (e.g., Pressure Below 20).

    -  Click the **Add** button to add the condition to the list.

    -  Use the **Delete** button to remove a selected condition from the list.

  .. figure:: media/image86.png
     :alt: Filters Tab of the Table Selection Dialog in EPANET
   
     Filters tab of the table selection dialog.
  ..

   Multiple conditions used to filter the table are connected by AND's.
   If a table has been filtered, a re-sizeable panel will appear at the
   bottom indicating how many items have satisfied the filter
   conditions.
 
   Once a table has been created, you can add/delete columns or sort or
   filter its data:

    -  Select **Report >> Options** or click |image132| on the Standard
       Toolbar or right-click on the table.

    -  Use the Columns and Filters pages of the Table Selection dialog form
       to modify your table.


.. _sec-view_special_reports:

Viewing Special Reports
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   In addition to graphs and tables, EPANET can generate several other
   specialized reports. These include:

    -  Status Report

    -  Energy Report

    -  Calibration Report

    -  Reaction Report

    -  Full Report

   All of these reports can be printed, copied to a file, or copied to
   the Windows clipboard (the Full Report can only be saved to file.)


**Status Report**

  EPANET writes all error and warning messages generated during an
  analysis to a Status Report (see :numref:`fig-ex_status_report`). Additional information
  on when network objects change status and a final mass balance accounting 
  for water quality analysis are also written to this report
  if the Status Report option in the project's Hydraulics Options was
  set to Yes or Full. For pressure driven analysis, node demand deficiency will also be reported in the status report.
  To view a status report on the most recently
  completed analysis select **Report >> Status** from the main menu.
 
  .. _fig-ex_status_report:
  .. figure:: media/image87.png
     :alt: Excerpt from an Example Status Report in EPANET

  ..

**Energy Report**

  EPANET can generate an Energy Report that displays statistics about
  the energy consumed by each pump and the cost of this energy usage
  over the duration of a simulation (see :numref:`fig-ex_energy_report`). To generate an
  Energy Report select **Report >> Energy** from the main menu. The
  report has two tabs, Table and Chart. One displays energy usage by pump in a
  tabular format. The second compares a selected energy statistic
  between pumps using a bar chart.

  .. figure:: media/image88.png
     :alt: Example Energy Report in EPANET

  ..	 
   
**Calibration Report**

  A Calibration Report can show how well EPANET's simulated results
  match measurements taken from the system being modeled. To create a
  Calibration Report:

    1. First make sure that Calibration Data for the quantity being
       calibrated has been registered with the project (see :numref:`sec-cal_data`).

    2. Select **Report >> Calibration** from the main menu.

    3. In the Calibration Report Options form that appears (see :numref:`fig-cal_report_ops`):

       -  Select a parameter to calibrate against

       -  Select the measurement locations to use in the report

    4. Click **OK** to create the report.

  .. _fig-cal_report_ops:
  .. figure:: media/image89.png
     :alt: Calibration Report Options Dialog in EPANET
   
     Calibration report options dialog.

  ..	 
    
  After the report is created the Calibration Report Options form can
  be recalled to change report options by selecting **Report >>
  Options** or by clicking |image135| on the Standard Toolbar when the
  report is the current active window in EPANET’s workspace.

  A sample Calibration Report is shown in :numref:`fig-ex_cal_report`. It contains
  three tabbed pages: Statistics, Correlation Plot, and Mean
  Comparisons.

  .. _fig-ex_cal_report:
  .. figure:: media/image90.png
     :alt: Example of a Calibration Report in EPANET
   
     Example of a calibration report.

  ..	 
   
  *Statistics Tab*

   The Statistics tab of a Calibration Report lists various error
   statistics between simulated and observed values at each measurement
   location and for the network as a whole. If a measured value at a
   location was taken at a time in-between the simulation's reporting
   time intervals then a simulated value for that time is found by
   interpolating between the simulated values at either end of the
   interval.

   The statistics listed for each measurement location are:

    -  Number of observations

    -  Mean of the observed values

    -  Mean of the simulated values

    -  Mean absolute error between each observed and simulated value

    -  Root mean square error (square root of the mean of the squared errors
       between the observed and simulated values)

   These statistics are also provided for the network as a whole (i.e.,
   all measurements and model errors pooled together). Also listed is
   the correlation between means (correlation coefficient between the
   mean observed value and mean simulated value at each location).

   *Correlation Plot Tab*

   The Correlation Plot tab of a Calibration Report displays a scatter
   plot of the observed and simulated values for each measurement made
   at each location. Each location is assigned a different color in the
   plot. The closer that the points come to the 45-degree angle line on
   the plot the closer is the match between observed and simulated
   values.

   *Mean Comparisons Tab*

   The Mean Comparisons tab of a Calibration Report presents a bar
   chart that compares the mean observed and mean simulated value for a
   calibration parameter at each location where measurements were taken.

**Reaction Report**

  A Reaction Report, available when modeling the fate of a reactive
  water quality constituent, graphically depicts the overall average
  reaction rates occurring throughout the network in the following
  locations:

    -  The bulk flow

    -  The pipe wall

    -  Within storage tanks

  A pie chart shows what percent of the overall reaction rate is
  occurring in each location. The chart legend displays the average
  rates in mass units per hour. A footnote on the chart shows the
  inflow rate of the reactant into the system.

  The information in the Reaction Report can show at a glance what
  mechanism is responsible for the majority of growth or decay of a
  substance in the network. For example, if one observes that most of
  the chlorine decay in a system is occurring in the storage tanks and
  not at the walls of the pipes then one might infer that a corrective
  strategy of pipe cleaning and replacement will have little effect in
  improving chlorine residuals.

  A Graph Options dialog box can be called up to modify the appearance
  of the pie chart by selecting **Report >> Options** or by clicking
  |image138| on the Standard Toolbar, or by right-clicking anywhere on
  the chart.

**Full Report**

  When the |image139| icon appears in the Run Status section of the
  Status Bar, a report of computed results for all nodes, links and
  time periods can be saved to file by selecting **Full** from the
  **Report** menu. This report, which can be viewed or printed outside
  of EPANET using any text editor or word processor, contains the
  following information:

    -  Project title and notes

    -  A table listing the end nodes, length, and diameter of each link

    -  A table listing energy usage statistics for each pump

    -  A pair of tables for each time period listing computed values for
       each node (demand, head, pressure, and quality) and for each link
       (flow, velocity, headloss, and status)


  This feature is useful mainly for documenting the final results of a
  network analysis on small to moderately sized networks (full report
  files for large networks analyzed over many time periods can easily
  consume dozens of megabytes of disk space). The other reporting tools
  described in this chapter are available for viewing computed results
  on a more selective basis.
