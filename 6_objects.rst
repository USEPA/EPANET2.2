Working with Objects
====================

*EPANET uses various types of objects to model a distribution system.
These objects can be accessed either directly on the network map or
from the Data page of the Browser window. This chapter describes what
these objects are and how they can be created, selected, edited,
deleted, and repositioned.*

.. _sec-type_objs:

Types of Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   EPANET contains both physical objects that can appear on the network
   map, and non-physical objects that encompass design and operational
   information. These objects can be classified as followed:

     1. Nodes
         a. Junctions
         b. Reservoirs
         c. Tanks

     2. Links
         a. Pipes
         b. Pumps
         c. Valves

     3. Map Labels

     4. Time Patterns

     5. Curves

     6. Controls
         a. Simple
         b. Rule-Based

Adding Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   **Adding a Node**

   To add a Node using the Map Toolbar:

      1. Click the button for the type of node (junction |image78|, reservoir
         |image79|, or tank |image80|) to add from the Map Toolbar if it is
         not already depressed.

      2. Move the mouse to the desired location on the map and click.



   To add a Node using the Browser:

      1. Select the type of node (junction, reservoir, or tank) from the
         Object list of the Data Browser.

      2. Click the Add button |image81|.

      3. Enter map coordinates with the Property Editor (optional).


   **Adding a Link**

   To add a straight or curved-line Link using the Map Toolbar:

      1. Click the button for the type of link to add (pipe |image82|, pump
         |image83|, or valve |image84| ) from the Map Toolbar if it is not
         already depressed.

      2. On the map, click the mouse over the link's start node.

      3. Move the mouse in the direction of the link’s end node, clicking it
         at those intermediate points where it is necessary to change the
         link’s direction.

      4. Click the mouse a final time over the link's end node.



   Pressing the right mouse button or the Escape key while drawing a
   link will cancel the operation.

   To add a straight line Link using the Browser:

      1. Select the type of link to add (pipe, pump, or valve) from the Object
         list of the Data Browser.

      2. Click the Add button.

      3. Enter the From and To nodes of the link in the Property Editor.



   **Adding a Map Label**

   To add a label to the map:

      1. Click the Text button |image85| on the Map Toolbar.

      2. Click the mouse on the map where label should appear.

      3. Enter the text for the label.

      4. Press the **Enter** key.



   **Adding a Curve**

   To add a curve to the network database:

      1. Select Curve from the object category list of the Data Browser.

      2. Click the Add button.

      3. Edit the curve using the Curve Editor (see below).



   **Adding a Time Pattern**

   To add a time pattern to the network:

      1. Select Patterns from the object category list of the Data Browser.

      2. Click the Add button.

      3. Edit the pattern using the Pattern Editor (see below).



   **Using a Text File**

   In addition to adding individual objects interactively, you can
   import a text file containing a list of node ID's with their
   coordinates as well as a list of link ID's and their connecting nodes
   (see :numref:`sec-import_partial_net`).

.. _sec-select_objs:

Selecting Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   To select an object on the map:

    1. Make sure that the map is in Selection mode (the mouse cursor has the
       shape of an arrow pointing up to the left). To switch to this mode,
       either click the Select Object button |image86| on the Map Toolbar or
       choose **Select Object** from the **Edit** menu.

    2. Click the mouse over the desired object on the map.



   To select an object using the Browser:

    1. Select the category of object from the dropdown list of the Data
       Browser\ **.**

    2. Select the desired object from the list below the category heading.

.. _sec-ed_visual_objs:

Editing Visual Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The Property Editor (see :numref:`sec-prop_ed`) is used to edit the properties
   of objects that can appear on the Network Map (Junctions, Reservoirs,
   Tanks, Pipes, Pumps, Valves, or Labels). To edit one of these
   objects, select the object on the map or from the Data Browser, then
   click the Edit button |image87| on the Data Browser (or simply
   double-click the object on the map). The properties associated with
   each of these types of objects are described in :numref:`table-junc_prop` 
   through :numref:`table-map_label_prop`.

   Note: The unit system in which object properties are expressed
   depends on the choice of units for flow rate. Using a flow rate
   expressed in cubic feet, gallons or acre-feet means that US units
   will be used for all quantities. Using a flow rate expressed in
   liters or cubic meters means that SI metric units will be used. Flow
   units are selected from the project’s Hydraulic Options which can be
   accessed from the **Project >> Defaults** menu. The units used for
   all properties are summarized in Appendix :ref:`units`.
 
   The junction properties are provided in :numref:`table-junc_prop`.

   **Note**: Pipe lengths can be automatically computed as pipes are
   added or repositioned on the network map if the **Auto-Length**
   setting is turned on. To toggle this setting On/Off either:

  - Select **Project >> Defaults** and edit the Auto-Length field on the
    Properties page of the Defaults dialog form.

  - Right-click over the Auto-Length section of the Status Bar and then
    click on the popup menu item that appears.

   Be sure to provide meaningful dimensions for the network map before
   using the Auto-Length feature (see :numref:`sec-set_map_dimensions`).

  Notes:


    1. A label's anchor node property is used to anchor the label relative
       to a given location on the map. When the map is zoomed in, the label
       will appear the same distance from its anchor node as it did under
       the full extent view. This feature prevents labels from wandering too
       far away from the objects they were meant to describe when a map is
       zoomed.

    2. The Meter Type and ID properties determine if the label will act as a
       meter. Meter labels display the value of the current viewing
       parameter (chosen from the Map Browser) underneath the label text.
       The Meter Type and ID must refer to an existing node or link in the
       network. Otherwise, only the label text appears.

   demand is entered as a new row in the table. The columns contain the
   following information:

    -  *Base Demand*: baseline or average demand for the category (required)

    -  *Time Pattern*: ID label of time pattern used to allow demand to vary with time (optional)

    -  *Category*: text label used to identify the demand category (optional)

   ..
 
   The table initially is sized for 10 rows. If additional rows are
   needed select any cell in the last row and hit the **Enter** key.

   **Note**: By convention, the demand placed in the first row of the
   editor will be considered the main category for the junction and will
   appear in the Base Demand field of the Property Editor.


**Source Quality Editor**

   The Source Quality Editor is a pop-up dialog used to describe the
   quality of source flow entering the network at a specific node. This
   source might represent the main treatment works, a well head or
   satellite treatment facility, or an unwanted contaminant intrusion.
   The dialog form, shown in :numref:`fig-source_quality_ed`, contains the following fields 
   (:numref:`table-source_quality_ed`):

   A water quality source can be designated as a concentration or
   booster source.

  -  A **concentration source** fixes the concentration of any external
     inflow entering the network, such as flow from a reservoir or from a
     negative demand placed at a junction.

  -  A **mass booster source** adds a fixed mass flow to that entering the
     node from other points in the network.

  -  A **flow paced booster source** adds a fixed concentration to that
     resulting from the mixing of all inflow to the node from other points
     in the network.

  -  A **setpoint booster source** fixes the concentration of any flow
     leaving the node (as long as the concentration resulting from all
     inflow to the node is below the setpoint).


   The concentration-type source is best used for nodes that represent
   source water supplies or treatment works (e.g., reservoirs or nodes
   assigned a negative demand). The booster-type source is best used to
   model direct injection of a tracer or additional disinfectant into
   the network or to model a contaminant intrusion.

.. _sec-copy_objs:

Copying and Pasting Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The properties of an object displayed on the Network Map can be
   copied and pasted into another object from the same category. To copy
   the properties of an object to EPANET's internal clipboard:

      1. Right-click the object on the map.

      2. Select **Copy** from the pop-up menu that appears.


   To paste copied properties into an object:

      1. Right-click the object on the map.

      2. Select **Paste** from the pop-up menu that appears.

.. _sec-shape_links:

Shaping and Reversing Links
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Links can be drawn as polylines containing any number of
   straight-line segments that add change of direction and curvature to
   the link. Once a link has been drawn on the map, interior points that
   define these line segments can be added, deleted, and moved (see
   :numref:`fig-reshape_link`). To edit the interior points of a link:

      1. Select the link to edit on the Network Map and click |image94| on the
         Map Toolbar (or select **Edit >> Select Vertex** from the Menu Bar,
         or right-click on the link and select **Vertices** from the popup
         menu).

      2. The mouse pointer will change shape to an arrow tip, and any existing
         vertex points on the link will be displayed with small handles around
         them. To select a particular vertex, click the mouse over it.

      3. To add a new vertex to the link, right-click the mouse and select
         **Add Vertex** from the popup menu (or simply press the **Insert**
         key on the keyboard).

      4. To delete the currently selected vertex, right-click the mouse and
         select **Delete Vertex** from the popup menu (or simply press the
         **Delete** key on the keyboard).

      5. To move a vertex to another location, drag it with the left mouse
         button held down to its new position.

      6. While in Vertex Selection mode you can begin editing the vertices for
         another link by clicking on the link. To leave Vertex Selection mode,
         right-click on the map and select **Quit Editing** from the popup
         menu, or select any other button on the Map Toolbar.

   ..

   A link can also have its direction reversed (i.e., its end nodes
   switched) by right- clicking on it and selecting **Reverse** from the
   pop-up menu that appears. This is useful for re-orienting pumps and
   valves that originally were added in the wrong direction.

.. _sec-delete_obj:

Deleting an Object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   To delete an object:

      1.  Select the object on the map or from the Data Browser.

      2. Either:

          -  Click |image96| on the Standard Toolbar

          -  Click the same button on the Data Browser

          -  Press the **Delete** key on the keyboard

      **Note**: You can require that all deletions be confirmed before they
      take effect. See the General Preferences page of the Program
      Preferences dialog box described in :numref:`sec-prog_pref`.

.. _sec-move_obj:

Moving an Object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   To move a node or label to another location on the map:

      1. Select the node or label.

      2. With the left mouse button held down over the object, drag it to its
         new location.

      3. Release the left button.


   Alternatively, new X and Y coordinates for the object can be typed in
   manually in the Property Editor. Whenever a node is moved all links
   connected to it are moved as well.

.. _sec-select_group_objs:

Selecting a Group of Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   To select a group of objects that lie within an irregular region of
   the network map:

      1. Select **Edit >> Select Region** or click |image97| on the Map
         Toolbar.

      2. Draw a polygon fence line around the region of interest on the map
         by clicking the left mouse button at each successive vertex of the
         polygon.

      3. Close the polygon by clicking the right button or by pressing the
         **Enter** key; Cancel the selection by pressing the **Escape** key.

   To select all objects currently in view on the map select **Edit >>
   Select All**. (Objects outside the current viewing extent of the map
   are not selected.)

   Once a group of objects has been selected, you can edit a common
   property (see the following section) or delete the selected objects
   from the network. To do the latter, click |image98| or press the
   **Delete** key.

.. _sec-ed_group_objs:

Editing a Group of Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   To edit a property for a group of objects:

      1. Select the region of the map that will contain the group of objects
         to be edited using the method described in previous section.

      2. Select **Edit >> Group Edit** from the Menu Bar.

      3. Define what to edit in the Group Edit dialog form that appears.



   The Group Edit dialog form, shown in :numref:`fig-group_ed_dialog`, is used to modify a
   property for a selected group of objects. To use the dialog form:

      1. Select a category of object (Junctions or Pipes) to edit.

      2. Check the "with" box if you want to add a filter that will limit the
         objects selected for editing. Select a property, relation and value
         that define the filter. An example might be "with Diameter below 12".

      3. Select the type of change to make - Replace, Multiply, or Add To.

      4. Select the property to change.

      5. Enter the value that should replace, multiply, or be added to the
         existing value.

      6. Click **OK** to execute the group edit.
