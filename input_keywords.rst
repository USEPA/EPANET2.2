  **OFFSET**      *X Y*
  =============== =============================

**Definitions:**

  DIMENSIONS
    Provides the X and Y coordinates of the lower-left and
    upper-right corners of the map’s bounding rectangle. Defaults are the
    extents of the nodal coordinates supplied in the [COORDINATES]
    section.

    Default is NONE.

  FILE
    Is the name of the file that contains the backdrop image.

  OFFSET
    Lists the X and Y distance that the upper-left corner of
    the backdrop image is offset from the upper-left corner of the map’s
    bounding rectangle. Default is zero offset.


**Remarks:**

  a. The [BACKDROP] section is optional and is not used at all when EPANET
     is run as a console application.

  b. Only Windows Enhanced Metafiles and bitmap files can be used as
     backdrops.

[CONTROLS]
----------

**Purpose:**

  Defines simple controls that modify links based on a single
  condition.

**Format:**

  One line for each control which can be of the form:

    ==== ======== ======== == ========= ======== =========== =======
    LINK *linkID* *status* IF NODE      *nodeID* ABOVE/BELOW *value*
    LINK *linkID* *status* AT TIME      *time*

    ==== ======== ======== == ========= ======== =========== =======

  where:

    | *linkID* = a link ID label
    | *status* = OPEN or CLOSED, a pump speed setting, or a control valve setting
    | *nodeID* = a node ID label
    | *value*  = a pressure for a junction or a water level for a tank
    | *time*   = a time since the start of the simulation in decimal hours or in
      hours:minutes format
    | *time* = a 12-hour clock time (hours:minutes)


**Remarks:**

  a. Simple controls are used to change link status or settings based on
     tank water level, junction pressure, time into the simulation or time
     of day.

  b. See the notes for the [STATUS] section for conventions used in
     specifying link status and setting, particularly for control valves.



**Examples:**

::

  [CONTROLS]
  ;Close Link 12 if the level in Tank 23 exceeds 20 ft.

  b. The coordinates represent the distance from the node to an arbitrary
     origin at the lower left of the map. Any convenient units of measure
     for this distance can be used.

  c. There is no requirement that all nodes be included in the map, and
     their locations need not be to actual scale.

  d. A [COORDINATES] section is optional and is not used at all when
     EPANET is run as a console application.



**Example:**

      | Efficiency v. Flow for pumps
      | Volume v. Depth for tanks
      | Headloss v. Flow for General Purpose Valves

  b. The points of a curve must be entered in order of increasing X-values
     (lower to higher).

  c. If the input file will be used with the Windows version of EPANET,
     then adding a comment which contains the curve type and description,
     separated by a colon, directly above the first entry for a curve will
     ensure that these items appear correctly in EPANET’s Curve Editor.
     Curve types include PUMP, EFFICIENCY, VOLUME, and HEADLOSS. See the
     examples below.


**Example:**

::

  b. Data in this section replaces any demand entered in [JUNCTIONS]
     section for the same junction.

  c. Unlimited number of demand categories can be entered per junction.

  d. If no demand pattern is supplied then the junction demand follows the
     Default Demand Pattern specified in the [OPTIONS] section or Pattern
     1 if no default pattern is specified. If the default pattern (or
     Pattern 1) does not exist, then the demand remains constant.

  One line for each emitter containing:

    -  Junction ID label

    -  Flow coefficient, flow units at 1 psi (1 meter) pressure drop


**Remarks:**

  a. Emitters are used to model flow through sprinkler heads or pipe
     leaks.

  b. Flow out of the emitter equals the product of the flow coefficient
     and the junction pressure raised to a power.

  c. The power can be specified using the EMITTER EXPONENT option in the
     [OPTIONS] section. The default power is 0.5, which normally applies
     to sprinklers and nozzles.

  d. Actual demand reported in the program's results includes both the
     normal demand at the junction plus flow through the emitter.

  e. An [EMITTERS] section is optional.

       varies with time,
     | **EFFIC** = either a single percent efficiency for global setting
       or the ID label of an efficiency curve for a specific pump,
     | **DEMAND CHARGE** = added cost per maximum kW usage during the
       simulation period.

  d. The default global pump efficiency is 75% and the default global
     energy price is 0.

  e. All entries in this section are optional. Items offset by slashes (/)
     indicate allowable choices.


**Example:**

::

  [ENERGY]
  GLOBAL  PRICE      0.05   ;Sets global energy price
  GLOBAL  PATTERN    PAT1   ;and time-of-day pattern

  b. If no demand pattern is supplied then the junction demand follows the
     Default Demand Pattern specified in the [OPTIONS] section or Pattern
     1 if no default pattern is specified. If the default pattern (or
     Pattern 1) does not exist, then the demand remains constant.

  c. Demands can also be entered in the [DEMANDS] section and include
     multiple demand categories per junction.



**Example:**

::

  [JUNCTIONS]
  ;ID    Elev.   Demand   Pattern
  ;------------------------------
  J1     100     50       Pat1

  ===================== ============================== ========


**Definitions:**

  UNITS
    Sets the units in which flow rates are expressed where:

    | **CFS** = cubic feet per second
    | **GPM** = gallons per minute
    | **MGD** = million gallons per day
    | **IMGD** = Imperial MGD
    | **AFD** = acre-feet per day
    | **LPS** = liters per second
    | **LPM** = liters per minute
    | **MLD** = million liters per day
    | **CMH** = cubic meters per hour
    | **CMD** = cubic meters per day

    For **CFS, GPM, MGD, IMGD**, and **AFD** other input quantities are
    expressed in US Customary Units. If flow units are in liters or cubic
    meters then Metric Units must be used for all other input quantities
    as well. (See Appendix A. Units of Measurement). The default flow units
    are **GPM**.

  HEADLOSS
    Selects a formula to use for computing head loss for
    flow through a pipe. The choices are the Hazen-Williams (**H-W**),
    Darcy-Weisbach (**D-W**), or Chezy-Manning (**C-M**) formulas. The
    default is **H-W**.

    The **HYDRAULICS** option allows you to either **SAVE** the current
    hydraulics solution to a file or **USE** a previously saved
    hydraulics solution. This is useful when studying factors that only
    affect water quality behavior.

  QUALITY
    Selects the type of water quality analysis to perform.
    The choices are **NONE, CHEMICAL, AGE**, and **TRACE**. In place of
    **CHEMICAL** the actual name of the chemical can be used followed by
    its concentration units (e.g., **CHLORINE mg/L**). If **TRACE** is
    selected it must be followed by the ID label of the node being
    traced. The default selection is **NONE** (no water quality
    analysis).

  VISCOSITY
    Is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid being modeled
    relative to that of water at 20 deg. C (1.0 centistoke). The default
    value is 1.0.

  DIFFUSIVITY
    Is the molecular diffusivity of the chemical being
    analyzed relative to that of chlorine in water. The default value is
    1.0. Diffusivity is only used when mass transfer limitations are
    considered in pipe wall reactions. A value of 0 will cause EPANET to
    ignore mass transfer limitations.

  SPECIFIC GRAVITY
    Is the ratio of the density of the fluid being
    modeled to that of water at 4 deg. C (unitless).

  TRIALS
    Are the maximum number of trials used to solve network
    hydraulics at each hydraulic time step of a simulation. The default
    is 40.

  ACCURACY
    Prescribes the convergence criterion that determines
    when a hydraulic solution has been reached. The trials end when the
    sum of all flow changes from the previous solution divided by the
    total flow in all links is less than this number. The default is
    0.001.

  HEADERROR
    Augments **ACCURACY** option. Sets the maximum head loss error
    that any network link can have for hydraulic convergence to occur.
    A link's head loss error is the difference between the head loss
    found as a function of computed flow in the link (such as by the
    Hazen-Williams equation for a pipe) and the difference in computed
    heads for the link's end nodes. The units of this parameter are
    feet (US) or meters (SI). The default value of 0 indicates that no
    head error limit applies.

  FLOWCHANGE
    Augments the **ACCURACY** option. Sets the largest change in flow
    that any network element (link, emitter, or pressure driven
    demand) can have for hydraulic convergence to occur. It is specified
    in whatever flow units the project is using. The default value of 0
    indicates that no flow change limit applies.

  UNBALANCED
    Determines what happens if a hydraulic solution cannot
    be reached within the prescribed number of **TRIALS** at some
    hydraulic time step into the simulation. **"STOP"** will halt the
    entire analysis at that point. **"CONTINUE"** will continue the
    analysis with a warning message issued. **"CONTINUE n"** will
    continue the search for a solution for another "n" trials with the
    status of all links held fixed at their current settings. The
    simulation will be continued at this point with a message issued
    about whether convergence was achieved or not. The default choice is
    **"STOP"**.

  PATTERN
    Provides the ID label of a default demand pattern to be
    applied to all junctions where no demand pattern was specified. If no
    such pattern exists in the [PATTERNS] section then by default the
    pattern consists of a single multiplier equal to 1.0. If this option
    is not used, then the global default demand pattern has a label of
    "1".

  DEMAND MULTIPLIER
    Is used to adjust the values of baseline demands for all junctions
    and all demand categories. For example, a value of 2 doubles all
    baseline demands, while a value of 0.5 would halve them. The default
    value is 1.0.

  DEMAND MODEL
    Determines nodal demand model -- Demand Driven Analysis (**DDA**) or
    Pressure Driven Analysis (**PDA**). DDA assumes a nodal demand at a given
    point in time is a fixed value :math:`D`. This sometimes results in
    hydraulic solutions with negative pressures (a physical impossibility).
    PDA assumes the demand delivered, :math:`d`, is a function of nodal
    pressure, :math:`p`, as follows:

    .. math::
       d = D \left[ \frac{p - P_{min}}{P_{req} - P_{min}} \right]^{Pexp}

    where :math:`D` is the full demand required, :math:`Pmin` is the pressure
    below which demand is zero, :math:`Preq` is the pressure required to
    deliver the full required demand and :math:`Pexp` is an exponent. When
    :math:`p < Pmin` demand is 0 and when :math:`p > Preq` demand equals
    :math:`D`. The default value is **DDA**.

  MINIMUM PRESSURE
    Value for :math:`Pmin`. Default value is 0.0.

  REQUIRED PRESSURE
    Value for :math:`Preq`. Default value is 0.0.

  PRESSURE EXPONENT
    Value for :math:`Pexp`. Default value is 0.5.

  EMITTER EXPONENT
    Specifies the power to which the pressure at a
    junction is raised when computing the flow issuing from an emitter.
    The default is 0.5.

  MAP
    Is used to supply the name of a file containing coordinates
    of the network's nodes so that a map of the network can be drawn. It
    is not used for any hydraulic or water quality computations.

  TOLERANCE
    Is the difference in water quality level below which
    one can say that one parcel of water is essentially the same as
    another. The default is 0.01 for all types of quality analyses
    (chemical, age (measured in hours), or source tracing (measured in
    percent)).

**Remarks:**

  a. All options assume their default values if not explicitly specified
     in this section.

  b. Items offset by slashes (/) indicate allowable choices.


**Example:**

::

  [OPTIONS]
  UNITS        CFS

  UNBALANCED   CONTINUE   10


---------------------


[PATTERNS]
----------

**Purpose:**

  Defines time patterns.

**Format:**

  One or more lines for each pattern containing:

    -  Pattern ID label
    -  One or more multipliers


**Remarks:**

  Multipliers define how some base quantity (e.g., demand) is
  adjusted for each time period.

  a. All patterns share the same time period interval as defined in the
     [TIMES] section.

  b. Each pattern can have a different number of time periods.

  c. When the simulation time exceeds the pattern length the pattern wraps
     around to its first period.

  d. Use as many lines as it takes to include all multipliers for each
     pattern.


**Example:**

::

  [PATTERNS]
  ;Pattern P1
  P1    1.1    1.4    0.9    0.7
  P1    0.6    0.5    0.8    1.0
  ;Pattern P2
  P2    1      1      1      1
  P2    0      0      1


---------------------


[PIPES]
-------

**Purpose:**

  Defines all pipe links contained in the network.

**Format:**

  One line for each pipe containing:

    -  ID label of pipe
    -  ID of start node
    -  ID of end node
    -  Length, ft (m)
    -  Diameter, inches (mm)
    -  Roughness coefficient
    -  Minor loss coefficient
    -  Status (OPEN, CLOSED, or CV)


**Remarks:**

  a. Roughness coefficient is unitless for the Hazen-Williams and
     Chezy-Manning head loss formulas and has units of millifeet (mm) for
     the Darcy-Weisbach formula. Choice of head loss formula is supplied
     in the [OPTIONS] section.

  b. Setting status to CV means that the pipe contains a check valve
     restricting flow to one direction.

  c. If minor loss coefficient is 0 and pipe is OPEN then these two items
     can be dropped form the input line.


**Example:**

**Purpose:**

  Defines all pump links contained in the network.

**Format:**

  One line for each pump containing:

    -  ID label of pump
    -  ID of start node
    -  ID of end node
    -  Keyword and Value (can be repeated)

      | **HEAD** - ID of curve that describes head versus flow for the pump
      | **SPEED** - relative speed setting (normal speed is 1.0, 0 means pump is off)
      | **PATTERN** - ID of time pattern that describes how speed setting varies with time

  b. Either **POWER** or **HEAD** must be supplied for each pump. The
     other keywords are optional.

**Purpose:**

  Defines initial water quality at nodes.

**Format:**

  One line per node containing:

    -  Node ID label
    -  Initial quality


**Remarks:**

  a. Quality is assumed to be zero for nodes not listed.

     or percent for source tracing.

  c. The [QUALITY] section is optional.


---------------------


[REACTIONS]
-----------

**Purpose:**

   Defines parameters related to chemical reactions occurring in the
   network.

**Format:**

  ========================= ====== =====
  **ORDER BULK/WALL/TANK**  value
  **GLOBAL BULK/WALL**      value
  **BULK/WALL/TANK**        pipeID value
  **LIMITING POTENTIAL**    value
  **ROUGHNESS CORRELATION** value
  ========================= ====== =====

**Definitions:**

  ORDER
    Is used to set the order of reactions occurring in the bulk
    fluid, at the pipe wall, or in tanks, respectively. Values for wall
    reactions must be either 0 or 1. If not supplied the default reaction
    order is 1.0.

  GLOBAL
    Is used to set a global value for all bulk reaction coefficients (pipes
    and tanks) or for all pipe wall coefficients. The default value is zero.

  BULK, WALL, and TANK
    Are used to override the global reaction coefficients for specific pipes
    and tanks.

  LIMITING POTENTIAL
    Specifies that reaction rates are proportional to the difference between
    the current concentration and some limiting potential value.

  ROUGHNESS CORRELATION
    Will make all default pipe wall reaction coefficients be related to pipe
    roughness in the following manner:

    ==================  =====================
    Head Loss Equation  Roughness Correlation
    ==================  =====================
    Hazen-Williams      :math:`F / C`
    Darcy-Weisbach      :math:`F / log(e/D)`
    Chezy-Manning       :math:`F*n`
    ==================  =====================

    where :math:`F` = roughness correlation, :math:`C` = Hazen-Williams C-factor,
    :math:`e` = Darcy-Weisbach roughness, :math:`D` = pipe diameter, and
    :math:`n` = Chezy-Manning roughness coefficient. The default value computed
    this way can be overridden for any pipe by using the **WALL** format to
    supply a specific value for the pipe.

**Remarks:**

  a. Remember to use positive numbers for growth reaction coefficients and
     negative numbers for decay coefficients.

  b. The time units for all reaction coefficients are 1/days.

  c. All entries in this section are optional. Items offset by slashes (/)
     indicate allowable choices.



**Example:**

::

  [REACTIONS]
  ORDER WALL    0    ;Wall reactions are zero-order
  GLOBAL BULK  -0.5  ;Global bulk decay coeff.
  GLOBAL WALL  -1.0  ;Global wall decay coeff.
  WALL   P220  -0.5  ;Pipe-specific wall coeffs.
  WALL   P244  -0.7

[REPORT]
--------

**Purpose:**

  Describes the contents of the output report produced from a
  simulation.

**Format:**

  ============ ========================= ===============
  **PAGESIZE** value
  **FILE**     filename
  **STATUS**   **YES/NO/FULL**
  **SUMMARY**  **YES/NO**
  **ENERGY**   **YES/NO**
  **NODES**    **NONE/ALL/**             node1 node2 ...
  **LINKS**    **NONE/ALL/**             link1 link2 ...
  parameter    **YES/NO**
  parameter    **BELOW/ABOVE/PRECISION** value
  ============ ========================= ===============


**Definitions:**

  PAGESIZE
    Sets the number of lines written per page of the output
    report. The default is 0, meaning that no line limit per page is in
    effect.

  FILE
    Supplies the name of a file to which the output report will
    be written (ignored by the Windows version of EPANET).

  STATUS
    Determines whether a hydraulic status report should be
    generated. If **YES** is selected the report will identify all
    network components that change status during each time step of the
    simulation. If **FULL** is selected, then the status report will also
    include information from each trial of each hydraulic analysis. This
    level of detail is only useful for de-bugging networks that become
    hydraulically unbalanced. The default is **NO**.

  SUMMARY
    Determines whether a summary table of number of network
    components and key analysis options is generated. The default is
    **YES**.

  ENERGY
    Determines if a table reporting average energy usage and
    cost for each pump is provided. The default is NO.

  NODES
    Identifies which nodes will be reported on. You can either
    list individual node ID labels or use the keywords **NONE** or
    **ALL**. Additional **NODES** lines can be used to continue the list.
    The default is **NONE**.

  LINKS
    Identifies which links will be reported on. You can either
    list individual link ID labels or use the keywords **NONE** or
    **ALL**. Additional **LINKS** lines can be used to continue the list.
    The default is **NONE**.

  The “parameter” reporting option is used to identify which quantities
  are reported on, how many decimal places are displayed, and what kind
  of filtering should be used to limit output reporting. Node
  parameters that can be reported on include:

    - **Elevation**
    - **Demand**
    - **Head**
    - **Pressure**
    - **Quality.**

  Link parameters include:

    - **Length**
    - **Diameter**
    - **Flow**
    - **Velocity**
    - **Headloss**
    - **Position** (same as status – open, active, closed)
    - **Setting** (Roughness for pipes, speed for pumps, pressure/flow setting for valves)
    - **Reaction** (reaction rate)
    - **F-Factor** (friction factor).


  The default quantities reported are **Demand, Head, Pressure**, and
  **Quality** for nodes and **Flow, Velocity**, and **Headloss** for links. The default precision
  is two decimal places.

**Remarks:**

  a. All options assume their default values if not explicitly specified
     in this section.

  b. Items offset by slashes (/) indicate allowable choices.

  c. The default is to not report on any nodes or links, so a **NODES** or
     **LINKS** option must be supplied if you wish to report results for
     these items.

  d. For the Windows version of EPANET, the only [REPORT] option
     recognized is **STATUS**. All others are ignored.


**Example:**

  The following example reports on nodes N1, N2, N3, and N17 and all
  links with velocity above 3.0. The standard node parameters (Demand,
  Head, Pressure, and Quality) are reported on while only Flow,
  Velocity, and F-Factor (friction factor) are displayed for links.

::

[RESERVOIRS]
------------

**Purpose:**

  Defines all reservoir nodes contained in the network.

**Format:**

  One line for each reservoir containing:

    -  ID label
    -  Head, ft (m)
    -  Head pattern ID (optional)


**Remarks:**

  a. Head is the hydraulic head (elevation + pressure head) of water in
     the reservoir.

  b. A head pattern can be used to make the reservoir head vary with time.

  c. At least one reservoir or tank must be contained in the network.


**Example:**

::

  [RESERVOIRS]
  ;ID    Head    Pattern
  ;---------------------
  R1     512               ;Head stays constant
  R2     120     Pat1      ;Head varies with time


---------------------


[RULES]
-------

**Purpose:**

   Defines rule-based controls that modify links based on a combination
   of conditions.

**Format:**

  Each rule is a series of statements of the form:

  ============ ===========
  **RULE**     ruleID
  **IF**       condition_1
  **AND**      condition_2
  **OR**       condition_3
  **AND**      condition_4
  etc.
  **THEN**     action_1
  **AND**      action_2
  etc.
  **ELSE**     action_3
  **AND**      action_4
  etc.
  **PRIORITY** value
  ============ ===========

  where:
    | ruleID  = an ID label assigned to the rule
    | conditon_n = a condition clause
    | action_n = an action clause
    | Priority = a priority value (e.g., a number from 1 to 5)


**Condition Clause Format:**

  A condition clause in a Rule-Based Control takes the form of:

  ====== == ========= ======== =====
  object id attribute relation value
  ====== == ========= ======== =====

  where:
    | object = a category of network object
    | id = the object's ID label
    | attribute = an attribute or property of the object
    | relation = a relational operator
    | value = an attribute value

  Some example conditional clauses are:

  ::

    JUNCTION 23 PRESSURE > 20
    TANK T200 FILLTIME BELOW 3.5
    LINK 44 STATUS IS OPEN
    SYSTEM DEMAND >= 1500
    SYSTEM CLOCKTIME = 7:30 AM

The Object keyword can be any of the following:

  ============= ========= ==========
  **NODE**      **LINK**  **SYSTEM**
  **JUNCTION**  **PIPE**
  **RESERVOIR** **PUMP**
  **TANK**      **VALVE**
  ============= ========= ==========

When **SYSTEM** is used in a condition no ID is supplied.

The following attributes can be used with Node-type objects:

  - **DEMAND**
  - **HEAD**
  - **PRESSURE**

The following attributes can be used with Tanks:

  - **LEVEL**
  - **FILLTIME** (hours needed to fill a tank)
  - **DRAINTIME** (hours needed to empty a tank)

These attributes can be used with Link-Type objects:

  - **FLOW**
  - **STATUS** (**OPEN**, **CLOSED**, or **ACTIVE**)
  - **SETTING** (pump speed or valve setting)

The **SYSTEM** object can use the following attributes:

  - **DEMAND** (total system demand)
  - **TIME** (hours from the start of the simulation expressed either as
    a decimal number or in hours:minutes format)
  - **CLOCKTIME** (24-hour clock time with **AM** or **PM** appended)

Relation operators consist of the following:

  ====== =========
  **=**  **IS**
  **<>** **NOT**
  **<**  **BELOW**
  **>**  **ABOVE**
  **<=** **>=**
  ====== =========

**Action Clause Format:**

  An action clause in a Rule-Based Control takes the form of:

  ====== == ============== == =====
  object id STATUS/SETTING IS value
  ====== == ============== == =====

  where:

    | object = LINK, PIPE, PUMP, or VALVE keyword
    | id = the object's ID label
    | value = a status condition (OPEN or CLOSED), pump speed setting, or valve
    | setting


  Some example action clauses are:

  ::

    LINK 23 STATUS IS CLOSED
    PUMP P100 SETTING IS 1.5
    VALVE 123 SETTING IS 90


**Remarks:**

  a. Only the **RULE**, **IF** and **THEN** portions of a rule are
     required; the other portions are optional.

  b. When mixing **AND** and **OR** clauses, the **OR** operator has
     higher precedence than **AND**, i.e.,

     ::

       IF A or B and C

     is equivalent to

     ::

       IF (A or B) and C.


     If the interpretation was meant to be

     ::

       IF A or (B and C)

     then this can be expressed using two rules as in

     ::

       IF A THEN ...
       IF B and C THEN ...

  c. The **PRIORITY** value is used to determine which rule applies when
     two or more rules require that conflicting actions be taken on a
     link. A rule without a priority value always has a lower priority
     than one with a value. For two rules with the same priority value,
     the rule that appears first is given the higher priority.



**Example:**

::

  [RULES]
  RULE 1
  IF TANK 1 LEVEL ABOVE 19.1
  THEN PUMP 335 STATUS IS CLOSED
  AND PIPE 330 STATUS IS OPEN

  RULE 2
  IF SYSTEM CLOCKTIME >= 8 AM
  AND SYSTEM CLOCKTIME < 6 PM
  AND TANK 1 LEVEL BELOW 12
  THEN PUMP 335 STATUS IS OPEN

  RULE 3
  IF SYSTEM CLOCKTIME >= 6 PM
  OR SYSTEM CLOCKTIME < 8 AM
  AND TANK 1 LEVEL BELOW 14
  THEN PUMP 335 STATUS IS OPEN


---------------------


[SOURCES]
---------

**Purpose:**

  Defines locations of water quality sources.

**Format:**

  One line for each water quality source containing:

    -  Node ID label
    -  Source type (**CONCEN, MASS, FLOWPACED**, or **SETPOINT**)
    -  Baseline source strength
    -  Time pattern ID (optional)


**Remarks:**

  a. For **MASS** type sources, strength is measured in mass flow per
     minute. All other types measure source strength in concentration
     units.

  b. Source strength can be made to vary over time by specifying a time
     pattern.

  c. A **CONCEN** source:

     | - Represents the concentration of any external source inflow to the node
     | - Applies only when the node has a net negative demand (water enters
       the network at the node)
     | - If the node is a junction, reported concentration is the result of
       mixing the source flow and inflow from the rest of the network
     | - If the node is a reservoir, the reported concentration is the
       source concentration
     | - If the node is a tank, the reported concentration is the internal
       concentration of the tank
     | - Is best used for nodes that represent source water supplies or
       treatment works (e.g., reservoirs or nodes assigned a negative demand)
     | - Should not be used at storage tanks with simultaneous
       inflow/outflow.

  d. A **MASS, FLOWPACED**, or **SETPOINT** source:

     | - Represents a booster source, where the substance is injected
       directly into the network irregardless of what the demand at the node is
     | - Affects water leaving the node to the rest of the network in the
       following way:

        | - A **MASS** booster adds a fixed mass flow to that resulting
          from inflow to the node
        | - A **FLOWPACED** booster adds a fixed concentration to the
          resultant inflow concentration at the node
        | - A **SETPOINT** booster fixes the concentration of any flow
          leaving the node (as long as the concentration resulting from
          the inflows is below the setpoint)

     | - The reported concentration at a junction or reservoir booster
       source is the concentration that results after the boosting is
       applied; the reported concentration for a tank with a booster
       source is the internal concentration of the tank
     | - Is best used to model direct injection of a tracer or disinfectant
       into the network or to model a contaminant intrusion.

  e. A [SOURCES] section is not needed for simulating water age or source
     tracing.


**Example:**

::

  [SOURCES]
  ;Node   Type   Strength  Pattern
  ;--------------------------------
    N1      CONCEN   1.2      Pat1    ;Concentration varies with time
    N44     MASS     12               ;Constant mass injection


---------------------


[STATUS]
--------

**Purpose:**

  Defines initial status of selected links at the start of a
  simulation.

**Format:**

  One line per link being controlled containing:

    - Link ID label
    - Status or setting


**Remarks:**

  a. Links not listed in this section have a default status of **OPEN**
     (for pipes and pumps) or **ACTIVE** (for valves).

  b. The status value can be **OPEN** or **CLOSED**. For control valves
     (e.g., PRVs, FCVs, etc.) this means that the valve is either fully
     opened or closed, not active at its control setting.

  c. The setting value can be a speed setting for pumps or valve setting
     for valves.

  d. The initial status of pipes can also be set in the [PIPES] section.

  e. Check valves cannot have their status be preset.

  f. Use [CONTROLS] or [RULES] to change status or setting at some future
     point in the simulation.

  g. If a **CLOSED** or **OPEN** control valve is to become **ACTIVE**
     again, then its pressure or flow setting must be specified in the
     control or rule that re-activates it.

**Example:**

::

  [STATUS]
  ; Link   Status/Setting
  ;----------------------
    L22     CLOSED         ;Link L22 is closed
    P14     1.5            ;Speed for pump P14
    PRV1    OPEN           ;PRV1 forced open
                           ;(overrides normal operation)


---------------------


[TAGS]
------

**Purpose:**

  Associates category labels (tags) with specific nodes and links.

**Format:**

  One line for each node and link with a tag containing

    - the keyword NODE or LINK
    - the node or link ID label
    - the text of the tag label (with no spaces)


**Remarks:**

  a. Tags can be useful for assigning nodes to different pressure zones or
     for classifying pipes by material or age.

  b. If a node or link’s tag is not identified in this section then it is
     assumed to be blank.

  c. The [TAGS] section is optional and has no effect on the hydraulic or
     water quality calculations.



**Example:**

::

  [TAGS]
  ;Object  ID       Tag
  ;------------------------------
   NODE    1001     Zone_A
   NODE    1002     Zone_A
   NODE    45       Zone_B
   LINK    201      UNCI-1960
   LINK    202      PVC-1985


---------------------


[TANKS]
-------

**Purpose:**

  Defines all tank nodes contained in the network.

**Format:**

  One line for each tank containing:

    - ID label
    - Bottom elevation, ft (m)
    - Initial water level, ft (m)
    - Minimum water level, ft (m)
    - Maximum water level, ft (m)
    - Nominal diameter, ft (m)
    - Minimum volume, cubic ft (cubic meters)
    - Volume curve ID (optional)


**Remarks:**

  a. Water surface elevation equals bottom elevation plus water level.

  b. Non-cylindrical tanks can be modeled by specifying a curve of volume
     versus water depth in the [CURVES] section.

  c. If a volume curve is supplied the diameter value can be any non-zero
     number

  d. Minimum volume (tank volume at minimum water level) can be zero for a
     cylindrical tank or if a volume curve is supplied.

  e. A network must contain at least one tank or reservoir.


**Example:**

::

  [TANKS]
  ;ID   Elev.  InitLvl  MinLvl  MaxLvl  Diam  MinVol  VolCurve
  ;-----------------------------------------------------------
  ;Cylindrical tank
  T1    100     15       5       25     120    0
  ;Non-cylindrical tank with arbitrary diameter
  T2    100     15       5       25      1     0      VC1


---------------------


[TIMES]
-------

**Purpose:**

  Defines various time step parameters used in the simulation.

**Format:**

  ====================== ====================
  **DURATION**           Value (units)
  **HYDRAULIC TIMESTEP** Value (units)
  **QUALITY TIMESTEP**   Value (units)
  **RULE TIMESTEP**      Value (units)

  **REPORT TIMESTEP**    Value (units)
  **REPORT START**       Value (units)
  **START CLOCKTIME**    Value (AM/PM)
  **STATISTIC**          **NONE/AVERAGED/**
                         **MINIMUM/MAXIMUM/**
                         **RANGE**
  ====================== ====================

**Definitions:**

  DURATION
    Is the duration of the simulation. Use 0 to run a single
    period snapshot analysis. The default is 0.

  HYDRAULIC TIMESTEP
    Determines how often a new hydraulic state of
    the network is computed. If greater than either the **PATTERN** or
    **REPORT** time step it will be automatically reduced. The default is
    1 hour.

  QUALITY TIMESTEP
    Is the time step used to track changes in water
    quality throughout the network. The default is 1/10 of the hydraulic
    time step.

  RULE TIMESTEP
    Is the time step used to check for changes in
    system status due to activation of rule-based controls between
    hydraulic time steps. The default is 1/10 of the hydraulic time step.

  PATTERN TIMESTEP
    Is the interval between time periods in all time
    patterns. The default is 1 hour.

  PATTERN START
    Is the time offset at which all patterns will
    start. For example, a value of 6 hours would start the simulation
    with each pattern in the time period that corresponds to hour 6. The
    default is 0.

  REPORT TIMESTEP
    Sets the time interval between which output
    results are reported. The default is 1 hour.

  REPORT START
    Is the length of time into the simulation at which
    output results begin to be reported. The default is 0.

  START CLOCKTIME
    Is the time of day (e.g., 3:00 PM) at which the
    simulation begins. The default is 12:00 AM midnight.

  STATISTIC
    Determines what kind of statistical post-processing should be done on the
    time series of simulation results generated. **AVERAGED** reports a set
    of time-averaged results, **MINIMUM** reports only the minimum values,
    **MAXIMUM** the maximum values, and **RANGE** reports the difference
    between the minimum and maximum values. **NONE** reports the full time
    series for all quantities for all nodes and links and is the default.

**Remarks:**

  a. Units can be **SECONDS (SEC), MINUTES (MIN), HOURS**, or **DAYS**.
     The default is hours.

  b. If units are not supplied, then time values can be entered as decimal
     hours or in hours:minutes notation.

  c. All entries in the [TIMES] section are optional. Items offset by
     slashes (/) indicate allowable choices.



**Example:**

::

  [TIMES]
  DURATION           240 HOURS
  QUALITY TIMESTEP   3 MIN
  REPORT START       120
  STATISTIC          AVERAGED
  START CLOCKTIME    6:00 AM

[TITLE]
-------

**Purpose:**

  Attaches a descriptive title to the network being analyzed.

**Format:**

  Any number of lines of text.

**Remarks:**

  The [TITLE] section is optional.


---------------------


[VALVES]
--------

**Purpose:**

  Defines all control valve links contained in the network.

**Format:**

  One line for each valve containing:

    - ID label of valve
    - ID of start node
    - ID of end node
    - Diameter, inches (mm)
    - Valve type
    - Valve setting
    - Minor loss coefficient


**Remarks:**

  a. Valve types and settings include:

    | Valve Type Setting PRV (pressure reducing valve) Pressure, psi (m)
    | PSV (pressure sustaining valve) Pressure, psi (m)
    | PBV (pressure breaker valve) Pressure, psi (m)
    | FCV (flow control valve) Flow (flow units)
    | TCV (throttle control valve) Loss Coefficient
    | GPV (general purpose valve) ID of head loss curve

  b. Shutoff valves and check valves are considered to be part of a pipe,
     not a separate control valve component (see [PIPES])


---------------------


[VERTICES]
----------

**Purpose:**

  Assigns interior vertex points to network links.

**Format:**

  One line for each point in each link containing such points that
  includes:

    -  Link ID label
    -  X-coordinate
    -  Y-coordinate


**Remarks:**

  a. Vertex points allow links to be drawn as polylines instead of simple
     straight-lines between their end nodes.

  b. The coordinates refer to the same coordinate system used for node and
     label coordinates.

  c. A [VERTICES] section is optional and is not used at all when EPANET
     is run as a console application.


**Example:**

::

  [VERTICES]
  ;Link      X-Coord.     Y-Coord
  ;-------------------------------
   1          10023       128
   2          10056       95
