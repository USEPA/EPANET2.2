Analyzing a Network
===================

*After a network has been suitably described, its hydraulic and water
quality behavior can be analyzed. This chapter describes how to
specify options to use in the analysis, how to run the analysis and
how to troubleshoot problems that might have occurred with the
analysis.*

Setting Analysis Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  There are five categories of options that control how EPANET analyzes
  a network: Hydraulics, Quality, Reactions, Times, and Energy. To set
  any of these options:

    1. Select the Options category from the Data Browser or select
       **Project >> Analysis Options** from the menu bar.

    2. Select Hydraulics, Quality, Reactions, Times, or Energy from the
       Browser.

    3. If the Property Editor is not already visible, click the Browser’s
       Edit button |image112| (or hit the **Enter** key).

    4. Edit your option choices in the Property Editor.



  As you are editing a category of options in the Property Editor you
  can move to the next or previous category by simply hitting the
  **Page Down** or **Page Up** keys, respectively.


**Hydraulic Options**

   Hydraulic options control how the hydraulic computations are carried
   out. They consist of the following items (:numref:`table-hyd_ops`):

  |                                   | deg. C (0.00112 sq ft/day). Use 2 |

  +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

..

   **Note**: The Quality Tolerance determines when the quality of one
   parcel of water is essentially the same as another parcel. For
   chemical analysis this might be the detection limit of the procedure
   used to measure the chemical, adjusted by a suitable factor of
   safety. Using too large a value for this tolerance might affect
   simulation accuracy. Using too small a value will affect
   computational efficiency. Some experimentation with this setting
   might be called for.

   quality analysis. They include the following (:numref:`table-rxn_ops`):

Running an Analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  To run a hydraulic/water quality analysis:

    1. Select **Project >> Run Analysis** or click |image113| on the
       Standard Toolbar.

    2. The progress of the analysis will be displayed in a Run Status
       window.

    3. Click **OK** when the analysis ends.



  If the analysis runs successfully the |image114| icon will appear in
  the Run Status section of the Status Bar at the bottom of the EPANET
  workspace. Any error or warning messages will appear in a Status
  Report window. If you edit the properties of the network after a
  successful run has been made, the faucet icon changes to a broken
  faucet indicating that the current computed results no longer apply
  to the modified network.

.. _sec-troubleshooting:

Troubleshooting Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

EPANET will issue specific Error and Warning messages when problems
are encountered in running a hydraulic/water quality analysis (see Appendix
:ref:`error_messages` for a complete listing). The most common problems are
discussed below.


**Pumps Cannot Deliver Flow or Head**

   EPANET will issue a warning message when a pump is asked to operate
   outside the range of its pump curve. If the pump is required to
   deliver more head than its shutoff head, EPANET will close the pump
   down. This might lead to portions of the network becoming
   disconnected from any source of water.


**Network is Disconnected**

   EPANET classifies a network as being disconnected if there is no way
   to provide water to all nodes that have demands. This can occur if
   there is no path of open links between a junction with demand and
   either a reservoir, a tank, or a junction with a negative demand. If
   the problem is caused by a closed link EPANET will still compute a
   hydraulic solution (probably with extremely large negative pressures)
   and attempt to identify the problem link in its Status Report. If no
   connecting link(s) exist EPANET will be unable to solve the hydraulic
   equations for flows and pressures and will return an Error 110
   message when an analysis is made. Under an extended period simulation
   it is possible for nodes to become disconnected as links change
   status over time.


**Negative Pressures Exist**

   When performing a demand driven analysis (DDA), EPANET will issue a
   warning message when it encounters negative pressures at junctions that
   have positive demands. This usually indicates that there is some problem
   with the way the network has been designed or operated. Negative pressures
   can occur when portions of the network can only receive water through
   links that have been closed off. In such cases an additional warning
   message about the network being disconnected is also issued.

   Alternatively, a pressure driven analysis (PDA) can be performed to
   determine a hydraulic solution assuming a pressure-demand relationship
   at junctions. The hydraulic solution found will have reduced or zero
   demands and negative pressures will be largely eliminated. This is
   considered a more "realistic" solution since large negative pressures
   in a network are not physically realistic.


**System Unbalanced**

   A System Unbalanced condition can occur when EPANET cannot converge
   to a hydraulic solution in some time period within its allowed
   maximum number of trials. This situation can occur when valves,
   pumps, or pipelines keep switching their status from one trial to the
   next as the search for a hydraulic solution proceeds. For example,
   the pressure limits that control the status of a pump may be set too
   close together. Or a pump's head curve might be too flat causing it
   to keep shutting on and off.

   To eliminate the unbalanced condition one can try to increase the
   allowed maximum number of trials or loosen the convergence accuracy
   requirement. Both of these parameters are set with the project’s
   Hydraulic Options. If the unbalanced condition persists, then another
   hydraulic option, labeled “If Unbalanced”, offers two ways to handle
   it. One is to terminate the entire analysis once the condition is
   encountered. The other is to continue seeking a hydraulic solution
   for another 10 trials with the status of all links frozen to their
   current values. If convergence is achieved then a warning message is
   issued about the system possibly being unstable. If convergence is
   not achieved then a “System Unbalanced” warning message is issued. In
   either case, the analysis will proceed to the next time period.

   If an analysis in a given time period ends with the system unbalanced
   then the user should recognize that the hydraulic results produced
   for this time period are inaccurate. Depending on circumstances, such
   as errors in flows into or out of storage tanks, this might affect
   the accuracy of results in all future periods as well.


**Hydraulic Equations Unsolvable**

   Error 110 is issued if at some point in an analysis the set of
   equations that model flow and energy balance in the network cannot be
   solved. This can occur when some portion of a system demands water
   but has no links physically connecting it to any source of water. In
   such a case EPANET will also issue warning messages about nodes being
   disconnected. The equations might also be unsolvable if unrealistic
   numbers were used for certain network properties.
