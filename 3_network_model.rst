The Network Model
=================


*This chapter discusses how EPANET models the physical objects that
constitute a distribution system as well as its operational
parameters. Details about how this information is entered into the
program are presented in later chapters. An overview is also given on
the computational methods that EPANET uses to simulate hydraulic and
water quality transport behavior.*

Physical Components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   EPANET models a water distribution system as a collection of links
   connected to nodes. The links represent pipes, pumps, and control
   valves. The nodes represent junctions, tanks, and reservoirs. :numref:`fig-physical_comp_WDS` 
   below illustrates how these objects can be connected to one
   another to form a network.

      Physical components in a water distribution system.
   ..

    
**Junctions**

    Junctions are points in the network where links join together and
    where water enters or leaves the network. The basic input data
    required for junctions are:

      -  Elevation above some reference (usually mean sea level)
	  
      -  Water demand (rate of withdrawal from the network)
	  
      -  Initial water quality

    The output results computed for junctions at all time periods of a
    simulation are:

      -  Hydraulic head (internal energy per unit weight of fluid)
	  
      -  Pressure
	  
      -  Water quality

    Junctions can also:

      -  Have their demand vary with time

      -  Have multiple categories of demands assigned to them

      -  Have negative demands indicating that water is entering the network

      -  Have pressure driven demand

      -  Be water quality sources where constituents enter the network

      -  Contain emitters (or sprinklers) which make the outflow rate depend
         on the pressure


**Reservoirs**

   Reservoirs are nodes that represent an infinite external source or
   sink of water to the network. They are used to model such things as
   lakes, rivers, groundwater aquifers, and tie-ins to other systems.
   Reservoirs can also serve as water quality source points.

   The primary input properties for a reservoir are its hydraulic head
   (equal to the water surface elevation if the reservoir is not under
   pressure) and its initial quality for water quality analysis.

   Because a reservoir is a boundary point to a network, its head and
   water quality cannot be affected by what happens within the network.
   Therefore it has no computed output properties. However its head can
   be made to vary with time by assigning a time pattern to it (see Time
   Patterns below).


**Tanks**

   Tanks are nodes with storage capacity, where the volume of stored
   water can vary with time during a simulation. The primary input
   properties for tanks are:

    -  Bottom elevation (where water level is zero)

    -  Diameter (or shape if non-cylindrical )

    -  Initial, minimum and maximum water levels

    -  Initial water quality


   The principal outputs computed over time are:

    -  Hydraulic head (water surface elevation)
	
    -  Water quality


   Tanks are required to operate within their minimum and maximum
   levels. EPANET stops outflow if a tank is at its minimum level and
   stops inflow if it is at its maximum level. Tanks can also serve as
   water quality source points.


**Emitters**

    Emitters are devices associated with junctions that model the flow
    through a nozzle or orifice that discharges to the atmosphere. The
    flow rate through the emitter varies as a function of the pressure
    available at the node:

    .. math::
       q = C p^{\gamma}

    where :math:`q` = flow rate, :math:`p` = pressure, :math:`C` = discharge
    coefficient, and :math:`\gamma` = pressure exponent. For nozzles and
    sprinkler heads :math:`\gamma` equals 0.5 and the manufacturer usually
    provides the value of the discharge coefficient in units of
    gpm/psi :sup:`0.5` (stated as the flow through the device at a 1 psi
    pressure drop).

    Emitters are used to model flow through sprinkler systems and
    irrigation networks. They can also be used to simulate leakage in a
    pipe connected to the junction (if a discharge coefficient and
    pressure exponent for the leaking crack or joint can be estimated) or
    compute a fire flow at the junction (the flow available at some
    minimum residual pressure). In the latter case one would use a very
    high value of the discharge coefficient (e.g., 100 times the maximum
    flow expected) and modify the junction's elevation to include the
    equivalent head of the pressure target. EPANET treats emitters as a
    property of a junction and not as a separate network component.

    .. note::
       The pressure-flow relation at a junction defined by an emitter
       should not be confused with the pressure-demand relation when
       performing a pressure driven analysis (PDA). See :ref:`Pressure Driven Demand<press_driven_analysis>`
       for more information.

**Pipes**

   Pipes are links that convey water from one point in the network to
   another. EPANET assumes that all pipes are full at all times. Flow
   direction is from the end at higher hydraulic head (internal energy
   per weight of water) to that at lower head. The principal hydraulic
   input parameters for pipes are:

    -  Start and end nodes

    -  Diameter

    -  Length

    -  Roughness coefficient (for determining headloss)

    -  Status (open, closed, or contains a check valve)


   The status parameter allows pipes to implicitly contain shutoff
   (gate) valves and check (non-return) valves (which allow flow in only
   one direction).

   The water quality inputs for pipes consist of:

    -  Bulk reaction coefficient

    -  Wall reaction coefficient


   These coefficients are explained more thoroughly in :numref:`sec-wq_sim_model`
   below.

   Computed outputs for pipes include:

    -  Flow rate

    -  Velocity

    -  Headloss

    -  Darcy-Weisbach friction factor

    -  Average reaction rate (over the pipe length)

    -  Average water quality (over the pipe length)


   The hydraulic head lost by water flowing in a pipe due to friction
   with the pipe walls can be computed using one of three different
   formulas:

    -  Hazen-Williams formula

    -  Darcy-Weisbach formula

    -  Chezy-Manning formula


   The Hazen-Williams formula is the most commonly used headloss formula
   in the US. It cannot be used for liquids other than water and was
   originally developed for turbulent flow only. The Darcy-Weisbach
   formula is the most theoretically correct. It applies over all flow
   regimes and to all liquids. The Chezy-Manning formula is more
   commonly used for open channel flow.

   Each formula uses the following equation to compute headloss between
   the start and end node of the pipe:

    .. math::
       h_{L} = A q^{B}

   where :math:`h_{L}` = headloss (Length), :math:`q` = flow rate (Volume/Time),
   :math:`A` = resistance coefficient, and :math:`B` = flow exponent. :numref:`table-pipe_headloss_formulas`
   lists expressions for the resistance coefficient and values for the flow
   exponent for each of the formulas. Each formula uses a different pipe
   roughness coefficient that must be determined empirically. :numref:`table-roughness_coeff`
   lists general ranges of these coefficients for different types of new
   pipe materials. Be aware that a pipe’s roughness coefficient can
   change considerably with age.

   With the Darcy-Weisbach formula EPANET uses different methods to
   compute the friction factor f depending on the flow regime:

    -  The Hagen–Poiseuille formula is used for laminar flow (Re < 2,000).

    -  The Swamee and Jain approximation to the Colebrook-White equation is
       used for fully turbulent flow (Re > 4,000).

    -  A cubic interpolation from the Moody Diagram is used for transitional
       flow (2,000 < Re < 4,000).



   Consult Chapter :ref:`analysis_algorithms` for the actual equations
   used.

   Pipes can be set open or closed at preset times or when specific
   conditions exist, such as when tank levels fall below or above
   certain set points, or when nodal pressures fall below or above
   certain values. See the discussion of Controls in Section 3.2.


**Minor Losses**

   Minor head losses (also called local losses) are caused by the added
   turbulence that occurs at bends and fittings. The importance of
   including such losses depends on the layout of the network and the
   degree of accuracy required. They can be accounted for by assigning
   the pipe a minor loss coefficient. The minor headloss becomes the
   product of this coefficient and the velocity head of the pipe, i.e.,

   .. math::
      h_L = K (\frac{v^2}{2g})

   where :math:`K` = minor loss coefficient, :math:`v` = flow velocity
   (Length/Time), and :math:`g` = acceleration of gravity
   (Length/Time :sup:`2`). :numref:`table-minor_loss_coeff` provides minor loss coefficients for
   several types of fittings.

**Pumps**

   Pumps are links that impart energy to a fluid thereby raising its
   hydraulic head. The principal input parameters for a pump are its
   start and end nodes and its pump curve (the combination of heads and
   flows that the pump can produce). In lieu of a pump curve, the pump
   could be represented as a constant energy device, one that supplies a
   constant amount of energy (horsepower or kilowatts) to the fluid for
   all combinations of flow and head.

   The principal output parameters are flow and head gain. Flow through
   a pump is unidirectional and EPANET will not allow a pump to operate
   outside the range of its pump curve.

   Variable speed pumps can also be considered by specifying that their
   speed setting be changed under these same types of conditions. By
   definition, the original pump curve supplied to the program has a
   relative speed setting of 1. If the pump speed doubles, then the
   relative setting would be 2; if run at half speed, the relative
   setting is 0.5 and so on. Changing the pump speed shifts the position
   and shape of the pump curve (see the section on Pump Curves below).

   As with pipes, pumps can be turned on and off at preset times or when
   certain conditions exist in the network. A pump’s operation can also
   be described by assigning it a time pattern of relative speed
   settings. EPANET can also compute the energy consumption and cost of a pump. Each pump can be assigned an
   efficiency curve and schedule of energy prices. If these are not
   supplied then a set of global energy options will be used.

   Flow through a pump is unidirectional. If system conditions require
   more head than the pump can produce, EPANET shuts the pump off. If
   more than the maximum flow is required, EPANET extrapolates the pump
   curve to the required flow, even if this produces a negative head. In
   both cases a warning message will be issued.


**Valves**

   Valves are links that limit the pressure or flow at a specific point
   in the network. Their principal input parameters include:

    -  Start and end nodes

    -  Diameter

    -  Setting

    -  Status


   The computed outputs for a valve are flow rate and headloss. The
   different types of valves included in EPANET are:

    -  Pressure Reducing Valve (PRV)

    -  Pressure Sustaining Valve (PSV)

    -  Pressure Breaker Valve (PBV)

    -  Flow Control Valve (FCV)

    -  Throttle Control Valve (TCV)

    -  General Purpose Valve (GPV)



   PRVs limit the pressure at a point in the pipe network. EPANET
   computes in which of three different states a PRV can be in:

    -  Partially opened (i.e., active) to achieve its pressure setting on
       its downstream side when the upstream pressure is above the setting

    -  Fully open if the upstream pressure is below the setting

    -  Closed if the pressure on the downstream side exceeds that on the
       upstream side (i.e., reverse flow is not allowed)



   PSVs maintain a set pressure at a specific point in the pipe network.
   EPANET computes in which of three different states a PSV can be in:

    -  Partially opened (i.e., active) to maintain its pressure setting on
       its upstream side when the downstream pressure is below this value

    -  Fully open if the downstream pressure is above the setting

    -  Closed if the pressure on the downstream side exceeds that on the
       upstream side (i.e., reverse flow is not allowed)


   PBVs force a specified pressure loss to occur across the valve. Flow
   through the valve can be in either direction. PBV's are not true
   physical devices but can be used to model situations where a
   particular pressure drop is known to exist.

   FCVs limit the flow to a specified amount. The program produces a
   warning message if this flow cannot be maintained without having to
   add additional head at the valve (i.e., the flow cannot be maintained
   even with the valve fully open).

   TCVs simulate a partially closed valve by adjusting the minor head
   loss coefficient of the valve. A relationship between the degree to
   which a valve is closed and the resulting head loss coefficient is
   usually available from the valve manufacturer.

   GPVs are used to represent a link where the user supplies a special
   flow - head loss relationship instead of following one of the
   standard hydraulic formulas. They can be used to model turbines, well
   draw-down or reduced-flow backflow prevention valves.

   Shutoff (gate) valves and check (non-return) valves, which completely
   open or close pipes, are not considered as separate valve links but
   are instead included as a property of the pipe in which they are
   placed.

   Each type of valve has a different type of setting parameter that
   describes its operating point (pressure for PRVs, PSVs, and PBVs;
   flow for FCVs; loss coefficient for TCVs, and head loss curve for
   GPVs).

   Valves can have their control status overridden by specifying they be
   either completely open or completely closed. A valve's status and its
   setting can be changed during the simulation by using control
   statements.

   Because of the ways in which valves are modeled the following rules
   apply when adding valves to a network:

    -  A PRV, PSV or FCV cannot be directly connected to a reservoir or tank
       (use a length of pipe to separate the two)

    -  PRVs cannot share the same downstream node or be linked in series

    -  Two PSVs cannot share the same upstream node or be linked in series

    -  A PSV cannot be connected to the downstream node of a PRV

Non-Physical Components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   In addition to physical components, EPANET employs three types of
   informational objects – curves, patterns, and controls - that
   describe the behavior and operational aspects of a distribution
   system.

**Curves**

   Curves are objects that contain data pairs representing a
   relationship between two quantities. Two or more objects can share
   the same curve. An EPANET model can utilize the following types of
   curves:

    -  Pump Curve

    -  Efficiency Curve

    -  Volume Curve

    -  Head Loss Curve Pump Curve


*Pump Curve*

   A Pump Curve represents the relationship between the head and flow
   rate that a pump can deliver at its nominal speed setting. Head is
   the head gain imparted to the water by the pump and is plotted on the
   vertical (Y) axis of the curve in feet (meters). Flow rate is plotted
   on the horizontal (X) axis in flow units. A valid pump curve must
   have decreasing head with increasing flow.

   EPANET will use a different shape of pump curve depending on the
   number of points supplied.

   *Single-Point Curve* -- A single-point pump curve is defined by a
   single head-flow combination that represents a pump's desired
   operating point. EPANET adds two more points to the curve by assuming
   a shutoff head at zero flow equal to 133% of the design head and a
   maximum flow at zero head equal to twice the design flow. It then
   treats the curve as a three-point curve. :numref:`fig-single_pt_pump_curve`
   shows an example of a single-point pump curve. 

   .. _fig-single_pt_pump_curve:
   .. figure:: media/image29.png
      :alt: Example of Single-Point Pump Curve
   
      Single-point pump curve.
   ..

   *Three-Point Curve* -- A three-point pump curve is defined by three
   operating points: a Low Flow point (flow and head at low or zero flow
   condition), a Design Flow point (flow and head at desired operating
   point), and a Maximum Flow point (flow and head at maximum flow).
   EPANET tries to fit a continuous function of the form

   .. math::

   through the three points to define the entire pump curve. In this
   function, :math:`h_{g}` = head gain, :math:`q` = flow rate, and :math:`A`,
   :math:`B`, and :math:`C` are constants. :numref:`fig-three_pt_pump_curve`

   *Multi-Point Curve* -- A multi-point pump curve is defined by
   providing either a pair of head-flow points or four or more such
   points. EPANET creates a complete curve by connecting the points with
   straight-line segments. :numref:`fig-multi_pt_pump_curve`
   shows an example of a multi-point pump curve.

*Efficiency Curve*

   An Efficiency Curve determines pump efficiency (Y in percent) as a
   function of pump flow rate (X in flow units). An example efficiency
   curve is shown in :numref:`fig-pump_eff_curve`. Efficiency should represent wire-to-water
   efficiency that takes into account mechanical losses in the pump itself
   as well as electrical losses in the pump's motor. The curve is used only
   for energy calculations. If not supplied for a specific pump then a
   fixed global pump efficiency will be used.

**Volume Curve**

   A Volume Curve determines how storage tank volume (Y in cubic feet or
   cubic meters) varies as a function of water level (X in feet or
   meters). It is used when it is necessary to accurately represent
   tanks whose cross-sectional area varies with height. The lower and
   upper water levels supplied for the curve must contain the lower and
   upper levels between which the tank operates. An example of a tank
   volume curve is given in :numref:`fig-tank_vol_curve`.

   .. _fig-tank_vol_curve:
   .. figure:: media/image32.png
      :alt: Example of Tank Volume Curve
   
      Tank volume curve.
   ..  
 
**Headloss Curve**

   A Headloss Curve is used to described the headloss (Y in feet or
   meters) through a General Purpose Valve (GPV) as a function of flow
   rate (X in flow units). It provides the capability to model devices
   and situations with unique headloss-flow relationships, such as
   reduced flow - backflow prevention valves, turbines, and well
   draw-down behavior.


*Time Patterns*

   A Time Pattern is a collection of multipliers that can be applied to
   a quantity to allow it to vary over time. Nodal demands, reservoir
   heads, pump schedules, and water quality source inputs can all have
   time patterns associated with them. The time interval used in all
   patterns is a fixed value, set with the project's Time Options (see
   :numref:`sec-analysis_ops`). Within this interval a quantity remains at a constant
   level, equal to the product of its nominal value and the pattern's
   multiplier for that time period. Although all time patterns must
   utilize the same time interval, each can have a different number of
   periods. When the simulation clock exceeds the number of periods in a
   pattern, the pattern wraps around to its first period again.

   As an example of how time patterns work consider a junction node with
   an average demand of 10 GPM. Assume that the time pattern interval
   has been set to 4 hours and a pattern with the following multipliers
   has been specified for demand at this node (:numref:`table-time_pat_multiplier`):
 
   .. _table-time_pat_multiplier:
   .. table:: Example Time Pattern Multipliers	
		
    +------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
    | Period     | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   |
    +============+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+
    | Multiplier | 0.5 | 0.8 | 1.0 | 1.2 | 0.9 | 0.7 |
    +------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
   ..

   Then during the simulation the actual demand exerted at this node
   will be as follows (:numref:`table-actual_demands`):
 
   .. _table-actual_demands:
   .. table:: Actual Demands at Node	
		
    +--------+--------+-----+------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
    | Hours  |    0-4 | 4-8 | 8-12 | 12-16 | 16-20 | 20-24 | 24-28 |
    +========+========+=====+======+=======+=======+=======+=======+
    | Demand |    5   | 8   | 10   | 12    | 9     | 7     | 5     |
    +--------+--------+-----+------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
   ..

*Controls*

   Controls are statements that determine how the network is operated
   over time. They specify the status of selected links as a function of
   time, tank water levels, and pressures at select points within the
   network. There are two categories of controls that can be used:

    -  Simple Controls

    -  Rule-Based Controls Simple Controls


**Simple Controls**
	
    Simple controls change the status or setting of a link based on:
	
	-  The water level in a tank
	
    -  The pressure at a junction

    -  The time into the simulation
	
    -  The time of day
 

    They are statements expressed in one of the following three formats:
	
    ==== = ====== == ========= = =========== =
    LINK x status IF NODE      y ABOVE/BELOW z
    LINK x status AT TIME      t
    LINK x status AT CLOCKTIME c AM/PM
    ==== = ====== == ========= = =========== =

    where:
    | x = a link ID label,
    | status = OPEN or CLOSED, a pump speed setting, or a control valve setting,
    | y = a node ID label,
    | z = a pressure for a junction or a water level for a tank,
    | t = a time since the start of the simulation (decimal hours or hours:minutes),
    | c = a 24-hour clock time.

	
    Some examples of simple controls are (:numref:`table-sim_controls`):

    .. table:: Examples of Simple Controls	
     
     +--------------------------------------+---------------------------------+

     |                                      | throughout the simulation)      |
     +--------------------------------------+---------------------------------+
    ..
	
    There is no limit on the number of simple control statements that can
    be used.

    **Note:** Level controls are stated in terms of the height of water
    above the tank bottom, not the elevation (total head) of the water
    surface.

    **Note:** Using a pair of pressure controls to open and close a link
    can cause the system to become unstable if the pressure settings are
    too close to one another. In this case using a pair of Rule-Based
    controls might provide more stability.
   

**Rule-Based Controls**

    Rule-Based Controls allow link status and settings to be based on a
    combination of conditions that might exist in the network after an
    initial hydraulic state of the system is computed. Here are several
    examples of Rule-Based Controls:

    **Example 1**:

     This set of rules shuts down a pump and opens a by-pass pipe when the
     level in a tank exceeds a certain value and does the opposite when
     the level is below another value.

     ::

       RULE 1
       IF TANK 1 LEVEL ABOVE 19.1
       THEN PUMP 335 STATUS IS CLOSED
       AND PIPE 330 STATUS IS OPEN

     ::

       RULE 2
       IF TANK 1 LEVEL BELOW 17.1
       THEN PUMP 335 STATUS IS OPEN
       AND PIPE 330 STATUS IS CLOSED



    **Example 2**:

     These rules change the tank level at which a pump turns on depending
     on the time of day.

     ::

       RULE 3
       IF SYSTEM CLOCKTIME >= 8 AM
       AND SYSTEM CLOCKTIME < 6 PM
       AND TANK 1 LEVEL BELOW 12
       THEN PUMP 335 STATUS IS OPEN

     ::

       RULE 4
       IF SYSTEM CLOCKTIME >= 6 PM
       OR SYSTEM CLOCKTIME < 8 AM
       AND TANK 1 LEVEL BELOW 14
       THEN PUMP 335 STATUS IS OPEN

    A description of the formats used with Rule-Based controls can be
    found in Appendix :ref:`command_line`, under the [RULES] heading.

Hydraulic Simulation Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   EPANET’s hydraulic simulation model computes junction heads and link
   flows for a fixed set of reservoir levels, tank levels, and water
   demands over a succession of points in time. From one time step to
   the next reservoir levels and junction demands are updated according
   to their prescribed time patterns while tank levels are updated using
   the current flow solution. The solution for heads and flows at a
   particular point in time involves solving simultaneously the
   conservation of flow equation for each junction and the headloss
   relationship across each link in the network. This process, known as
   “hydraulically balancing” the network, requires using an
   iterative technique to solve the nonlinear equations involved. EPANET
   employs the “Gradient Algorithm” for this purpose. Consult Chapter :ref:`analysis_algorithms`
   for details.

   The hydraulic time step used for extended period simulation (EPS) can
   be set by the user. A typical value is 1 hour. Shorter time steps
   than normal will occur automatically whenever one of the following
   events occurs:

    -  The next output reporting time period occurs
    -  The next time pattern period occurs
    -  A tank becomes empty or full
    -  A simple control or rule-based control is activated

.. _sec-wq_sim_model:

Water Quality Simulation Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


**Basic Transport**

   EPANET’s water quality simulator uses a Lagrangian time-based
   approach to track the fate of discrete parcels of water as they move
   along pipes and mix together at junctions between fixed-length time
   steps. These water quality time steps are typically much shorter than
   the hydraulic time step (e.g., minutes rather than hours) to
   accommodate the short times of travel that can occur within pipes.

   The method tracks the concentration and size of a series of
   non-overlapping segments of water that fills each link of the
   network. As time progresses, the size of the most upstream segment in
   a link increases as water enters the link while an equal loss in size
   of the most downstream segment occurs as water leaves the link. The
   size of the segments in between these remains unchanged.

   For each water quality time step, the contents of each segment are
   subjected to reaction, a cumulative account is kept of the total mass
   and flow volume entering each node, and the positions of the segments
   are updated. New node concentrations are then calculated, which
   include the contributions from any external sources. Storage tank
   concentrations are updated depending on the type of mixing model that
   is used (see below). Finally, a new segment will be created at the
   end of each link that receives inflow from a node if the new node
   quality differs by a user-specified tolerance from that of the link’s
   last segment.

   Initially each pipe in the network consists of a single segment whose
   quality equals the initial quality assigned to the upstream node.
   Whenever there is a flow reversal in a pipe, the pipe’s parcels are
   re-ordered from front to back.


**Mixing in Storage Tanks**

   EPANET can use four different types of models to characterize mixing
   within storage tanks:

    -  Complete Mixing
    -  Two-Compartment Mixing
    -  First-in First-out (FIFO) Plug Flow
    -  Last-in First-out (LIFO) Plug Flow


   Different models can be used with different tanks within a network.
 
   The Complete Mixing model (:numref:`fig-complete_mix`) assumes that all water that
   enters a tank is instantaneously and completely mixed with the water
   already in the tank. It is the simplest form of mixing behavior to
   assume, requires no extra parameters to describe it, and seems to
   apply quite well to a large number of facilities that operate in
   fill-and-draw fashion.
   
   .. _fig-complete_mix:
   .. figure:: media/image33.png
      :alt: Example of Complete Mixing Model
   
      Complete mixing.
   ..
   
   The Two-Compartment Mixing model (:numref:`fig-two_comp_mix`) divides the
   available storage volume in a tank into two compartments, both of
   which are assumed completely mixed. The inlet/outlet pipes of the
   tank are assumed to be located in the first compartment. New water
   that enters the tank mixes with the water in the first compartment. If this compartment is full, then it sends its
   overflow to the second compartment where it completely mixes with the
   water already stored there. When water leaves the tank, it exits from
   the first compartment, which if full, receives an equivalent amount
   of water from the second compartment to make up the difference. The
   first compartment is capable of simulating short-circuiting between
   inflow and outflow while the second compartment can represent dead
   zones. The user must supply a single parameter, which is the fraction
   of the total tank volume devoted to the first compartment.
   
   .. _fig-two_comp_mix:
   .. figure:: media/image34.png
      :alt: Example of Two-Compartment Mixing Model
   
      Two-compartment mixing.
   ..
 
   The FIFO Plug Flow model (:numref:`fig-FIFO_plug`) assumes that there is no
   mixing of water at all during its residence time in a tank. Water
   parcels move through the tank in a segregated fashion where the first
   parcel to enter is also the first to leave. Physically speaking, this
   model is most appropriate for baffled tanks that operate with
   simultaneous inflow and outflow. There are no additional parameters
   needed to describe this mixing model.
   
   .. _fig-FIFO_plug:
   .. figure:: media/image35.png
      :alt: Example of Plug Flow - FIFO Model
   
      Plug flow - FIFO.
   ..

   The LIFO Plug Flow model (:numref:`fig-LIFO_plug`) also assumes that there is
   no mixing between parcels of water that enter a tank. However in
   contrast to FIFO Plug Flow, the water parcels stack up one on top of
   another, where water enters and leaves the tank on the bottom. This
   type of model might apply to a tall, narrow standpipe with an
   inlet/outlet pipe at the bottom and a low momentum inflow. It
   requires no additional parameters be provided.
   
   .. _fig-LIFO_plug:
   .. figure:: media/image36.png
      :alt: Example of Plug Flow - LIFO Model
   
      Plug flow - LIFO.
   ..


**Water Quality Reactions**

   EPANET can track the growth or decay of a substance by reaction as it
   travels through a distribution system. In order to do this it needs
   to know the rate at which the substance reacts and how this rate
   might depend on substance concentration. Reactions can occur both
   within the bulk flow and with material along the pipe wall. This is
   illustrated in :numref:`fig-reaction_zones`. In this example free chlorine (HOCl) is
   shown reacting with natural organic matter (NOM) in the bulk phase
   and is also transported through a boundary layer at the pipe wall to
   oxidize iron (Fe) released from pipe wall corrosion. Bulk fluid
   reactions can also occur within tanks. EPANET allows a modeler to
   treat these two reaction zones separately.
  
   .. _fig-reaction_zones:
   .. figure:: media/image36-2.png
      :alt: Reaction Zones Within a Pipe
   
      Reaction zones within a pipe.
   ..

*Bulk Reactions*

   EPANET models reactions occurring in the bulk flow with n-th order
   kinetics, where the instantaneous rate of reaction (:math:`R` in
   mass/volume/time) is assumed to be concentration-dependent according
   to

   .. math::
      R = K_{b} C^{n}

   Here :math:`K_{b}` = a bulk reaction rate coefficient, :math:`C` = reactant
   concentration (mass/volume), and :math:`n` = a reaction order. :math:`K_b`
   has units of concentration raised to the :math:`(1 - n)`` power divided by
   time. It is positive for growth reactions and negative for decay reactions.

   EPANET can also consider reactions where a limiting concentration
   exists on the ultimate growth or loss of the substance. In this case
   the rate expression becomes

   .. math::
      \begin{gathered}
        R = K_{b} (C_{L} - C) \times C^{(n - 1)} \\
        for\ n > 0, K_{b} > 0
      \end{gathered}

   .. math::
      \begin{gathered}
        R = K_{b} (C - C_{L} ) \times C^{(n - 1)} \\
        for\ n > 0, K_{b} < 0
      \end{gathered}


   where :math:`C_L` = the limiting concentration. Thus there are three
   parameters (:math:`K_b`, :math:`C_L`, and :math:`n`) that are used to
   characterize bulk reaction rates. Some special cases of well-known kinetic
   models are provided in :numref:`table-kinetic_models` (see :numref:`sec-analysis_alg_WQ` for more examples):

   .. _table-kinetic_models:

    |                       |  n = 0`               |                       |

    +-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
   ..

   The :math:`K_b` for first-order reactions can be estimated by placing a
   sample of water in a series of non-reacting glass bottles and
   analyzing the contents of each bottle at different points in time. If
   the reaction is first-order, then plotting the natural log
   :math:`(C_t / C_0)` against time should result in a straight line, where
   :math:`C_t` is concentration at time :math:`t` and :math:`C_0` is
   concentration at time zero. :math:`K_b` would then be estimated as the
   slope of this line.

   Bulk reaction coefficients usually increase with increasing
   temperature. Running multiple bottle tests at different temperatures
   will provide more accurate assessment of how the rate coefficient
   varies with temperature


*Wall Reactions*

   The rate of water quality reactions occurring at or near the pipe
   wall can be considered to be dependent on the concentration in the
   bulk flow by using an expression of the form

   .. math::
      R = ( A / V ) K_{w} C^{n}

   where :math:`K_{w}` = a wall reaction rate coefficient and :math:`(A / V)`
   = the surface area per unit volume within a pipe (equal to 4 divided by the
   pipe diameter). The latter term converts the mass reacting per unit
   of wall area to a per unit volume basis. EPANET limits the choice of
   wall reaction order to either 0 or 1, so that the units of :math:`K_{w}` are
   either mass/area/time or length/time, respectively. As with :math:`K_{b}`,
   :math:`K_{w}` must be supplied to the program by the modeler. First-order
   :math:`K_{w}` values can range anywhere from 0 to as much as 5 ft/day.

   The variable :math:`K_{w}` should be adjusted to account for any mass transfer
   limitations in moving reactants and products between the bulk flow
   and the wall. EPANET does this automatically, basing the adjustment
   on the molecular diffusivity of the substance being modeled and on
   the flow's Reynolds number. See :numref:`sec-analysis_alg_WQ` for details. (Setting the
   molecular diffusivity to zero will cause mass transfer effects to be
   ignored.)

   The wall reaction coefficient can depend on temperature and can also
   be correlated to pipe age and material. It is well known that as
   metal pipes age their roughness tends to increase due to encrustation
   and tuburculation of corrosion products on the pipe walls. This
   increase in roughness produces a lower Hazen-Williams C-factor or a
   higher Darcy-Weisbach roughness coefficient, resulting in greater
   frictional head loss in flow through the pipe.

   There is some evidence to suggest that the same processes that
   increase a pipe's roughness with age also tend to increase the
   reactivity of its wall with some chemical species, particularly
   chlorine and other disinfectants. EPANET can make each pipe's :math:`K_{w}`
   be a function of the coefficient used to describe its roughness. A
   different function applies depending on the formula used to compute
   headloss through the pipe (:numref:`table-headloss_wall_rxn`):

    +-----------------------------+-----------------------------+
    |     Headloss Formula        |  Wall Reaction Formula      |
    +=============================+=============================+
    |     Hazen-Williams          |   :math:`K_w = F / C`       |
    +-----------------------------+-----------------------------+
    |     Darcy-Weisbach          |:math:`K_w = -F / \log(e/d)` |
    +-----------------------------+-----------------------------+
    |     Chezy-Manning           |    :math:`K_w = F n`        |
    +-----------------------------+-----------------------------+
   ..
   
   where :math:`C` = Hazen-Williams C-factor, :math:`e` = Darcy-Weisbach
   roughness, :math:`d` = pipe diameter, :math:`n` = Manning roughness
   coefficient, and :math:`F` = wall reaction - pipe roughness coefficient.
   The coefficient :math:`F` must be developed from site-specific field
   measurements and will have a different meaning depending on which head
   loss equation is used. The advantage of using this approach is that it
   requires only a single parameter, :math:`F`, to allow wall reaction
   coefficients to vary throughout the network in a physically meaningful way.


**Water Age and Source Tracing**

   In addition to chemical transport, EPANET can also model the changes
   in the age of water throughout a distribution system. Water age is
   the time spent by a parcel of water in the network. New water
   entering the network from reservoirs or source nodes enters with age
   of zero. Water age provides a simple, non-specific measure of the
   overall quality of delivered drinking water. Internally, EPANET
   treats age as a reactive constituent whose growth follows zero-order
   kinetics with a rate constant equal to 1 (i.e., each second the water
   becomes a second older).

   EPANET can also perform source tracing. Source tracing tracks over
   time what percent of water reaching any node in the network had its
   origin at a particular node. The source node can be any node in the
   network, including tanks or reservoirs. Internally, EPANET treats
   this node as a constant source of a non-reacting constituent that
   enters the network with a concentration of 100. Source tracing is a
   useful tool for analyzing distribution systems drawing water from two
   or more different raw water supplies. It can show to what degree
   water from a given source blends with that from other sources, and
   how the spatial pattern of this blending changes over time.
